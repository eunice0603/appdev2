# Course Retrospective Assignment

### Name: Eunice Lugtu
### Course: Bachelor of Science in Information Systems
### Section: BSIS-3B

---

### 1. What went well
- I really enjoyed learning the **basics of React and JSX** and converting an html/css code to JSX.
- I felt confident when we learned about the **basic Git commands** and applied it in our earlier activities.
- I also enjoyed making a portfolio using Github and React.
- Since I am really not that proficient with development, I find learning React somewhat perceivable and understandable.
- I believe I have improved my leadership, management, and communication skills throughout the first semester.

---

### 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- I found it really difficult to identify the correct JSX syntax, that is why I really failed my Finals Written Exam.
- Coding, or developing in general, is really not my forte. So I find it *hard* to grasp the concepts sometimes.
- Since it is really my first time to be an actual project manager of a project, I had some difficulty managing my team so there were lapses and shortcomings on my part. Some tasks were overlooked and I was not really hands-on, so the output of our project is not really great.

### 3. Key Learnings
- Since the online converter tool is not really 100% accurate, I had to double check the syntax, fix the indentations—to sum it up, debug and fix the code. So I can say I have improved that specific skill.
- Moreover, I am able to improve my communication and collaboration with my team, since handling a project that involves developing a system requires time, focus, and attention.

### 4. Areas for Improvement
- I want to strengthen my knowledge about React, and try to understand the basic concepts and syntax of React Native.
- I also want to be able to write basic syntax on my own without full-reliance on AI or other helpers.
- To be able to really contribute to my team, I will focus on learning even just the basics of mobile application development to understand our developers’ perspectives and insights, monitor our prototype, and assist our SQA and BA with their tasks.

---

### 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- Mobile development is really new to me, so I would like to know how similar and different it is with web development.
- It would be nice to have some exercises or activities to really master (somehow) even just the basics of Typescript or any other tools used in Mobile development.
